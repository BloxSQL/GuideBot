Memory Store functions similarly to a Datastore, but it differs in that it is temporary. It is typically used for basic storage, such as player statistics or lobby systems.

The direct methods for Memory Store are...

```lua
local MemoryStore = game:GetService("MemoryStore")

MemoryStore:GetHashMap("Memory Store Section Name")

MemoryStore:GetSortedMap("Memory Store Section Name")

MemoryStore:GetQueue("Memory Store Section Name") 
```
