The `MemoryStore:GetHashMap()` method returns an object that we'll refer to as your memory store section. This object allows you to perform various operations on the data stored within the memory store.

Here are the available methods for working with a memory store:

```lua
local MemoryStore = game:GetService("MemoryStore")

local StoreMap = MemoryStore:GetHashMap("Example")

-- METHODS BELOW

StoreMap:GetAsync("Key") -- Retrieves the data associated with the specified key.

StoreMap:ListItemsAsync(Number Per Page) -- Returns a memory store page that lets you iterate through items in the memory store.

StoreMap:RemoveAsync("Key") -- Deletes the data associated with the specified key from the memory store.

StoreMap:SetAsync("Key", "Value", expiration) -- Stores a value in the memory store with an optional expiration time.

StoreMap:UpdateAsync("Key", "Value", expiration) -- Updates the value of an existing key, allowing for expiration updates as well.
```
