MemoryStore:GetQueue() method returns an object, which we'll call your memory store queue. This functions similarly to a sorted map, but with the added advantage of being ordered. Essentially, it allows you to queue data, which can be useful for systems like game lobbies.

Below are the available methods for interacting with a memory store queue:

```lua
local MemoryStore = game:GetService("MemoryStore")
local Queue = MemoryStore:GetQueue("Example")

-- METHODS

Queue:AddAsync(value, expiration, priority) -- Refer to the documentation for details, as this method is quite complex.

Queue:ReadAsync(count, allOrNothing, waitTimeout) -- Refer to the documentation for details, as this method is quite complex.

Queue:RemoveAsync(id) -- Refer to the documentation for details, as this method is quite complex.
```
